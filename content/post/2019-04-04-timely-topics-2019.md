Mahalo for registering for [Timely Topics in Pediatrics 2019](https://aaphawaii.org/events/) to be held at the Ala Moana Hotel on April 4, 2019.

We are again distributing the handouts electronically. This allows us to get these to you faster, keeps your conference costs down, and helps the environment!

<em>Please download the slide format of your choice to your phone, tablet, or laptop before the conference.</em> Below are links to download the slides in various formats (1 slide per page, 2 slides per page, etc.).

You may also print these slides at home if you prefer. No paper copies of the slides will be available at the conference site.
